# How to contribute

Thank you for wanting to contribute, we really appreciate it. Please look at our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/guardian/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before getting started.

For the time being we will only respond to bugs and reports of security vulnerabilities, so **please don't raise PRs**. In the future we will be looking for code contributions, so watch this space.

## Bugs

Please [create a github issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) describing the bug and including as much detail as possible. Check first that someone hasn't raised a similar issue already.

## Security vulnerabilities

Please see the ["Security" section in the README file](https://github.com/guardian/coverdrop/blob/main/README.md#security).
