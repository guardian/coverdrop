# Compose your first message

We receive hundreds of tips a day. The messages that stand out are clear, detailed and fact-focused.
Paul Lewis
Head of investigations

Messages are most credible when they are packed with facts, refer to evidence for those facts, and provide some context for how you know this.

## Include what’s safe

### Facts

Specifics are critical - such as names, locations and dates.

EXAMPLE
I work at ~government department ‘Department name’~ in the ~procurement section~.

### Clearly state the nature of your tip

Be concise and focus on what you know, rather than what you think or suspect.

EXAMPLE
I have discovered ~evidence of a senior official's involvement in corruption and bribery~. ‘Name’, the head of our section, has received $150,000 in under-the-radar payments.

### Evidence

Tell us how you know what you know, and how we might verify it.

EXAMPLE
I have ~photographic evidence of transactions~ from the past two years and access to ~further documents~ that show these were a quid pro quo for awarding contracts to multinational company ‘Company name’.

Our journalists appreciate that sharing information can be intimidating. You should only share what is best for your safety. However, vague messages are rarely actionable.

## Try to avoid…

### Being vague

Journalists need facts. If you don't explain the who, what, how and when, a reporter is unlikely to spend time trying to work out what you're talking about. Something like the following is unlikely to get a response:

EXAMPLE
I have ~some information~, would you like to know more? ~Someone I know~ is doing ~something illegal~.

### Anonymity

The Secure Messaging system doesn't let us know who you are. If you don't want to be identified as a result of our reporting, we will do everything we can to prevent that from happening. But the credibility of a story tip relies on the credibility of its source. If you can share why you know what you know, it's far more likely to be taken seriously.

EXAMPLE
I know about a criminal abuse of power but ~I can't tell you how I know it~.

### Time pressure

Reply times can vary. It could take several days. If it can’t wait, consider faster but less secure methods such as email or telephone.

EXAMPLE
Make sure you reply to me on here by the ~end of today~.
