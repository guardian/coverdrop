# Secure Messaging privacy policy

The Secure Messaging software in the Guardian app is currently in a testing phase. At this stage the feature does not have a distinct privacy policy to that which we publish for the rest of the Guardian app.

### All Secure Messaging users are anonymous

This feature is designed to be used anonymously. As a consequence, messages sent to our journalists using Secure Messaging contain no accompanying data about who sent that message, from where, and from what kind of device. We can't even tell exactly when you wrote a message.

If you are signed in to the Guardian app, that information is not known by the Secure Messaging feature. Similarly, the rest of the Guardian app on your mobile device does not know if you are sending messages to the Guardian using Secure Messaging. The Secure Messaging App cannot discover anything about you that you don't choose to tell us.

Your correspondence with our journalists is held in an encrypted vault on your phone. This vault is secured by a passphrase known only to you. Messages disappear automatically after 14 days.

At the point at which you send any information to us, the Guardianâ€™s Editorial Code applies. See theguardian.com/editorial-code
