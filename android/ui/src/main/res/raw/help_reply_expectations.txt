# What to expect as a reply

We may not reply to all messages. If we do reply, you can expect the following:

- Once we enter into correspondence with you, that conversation and any reporting that may come of it falls under the Guardianâ€™s Editorial Code. See theguardian.com/editorial-code
- If you messaged a team rather than an individual, a reporter or editor will identify themself in the reply. 
- They may ask you for more details about your tip.
- They may ask for more details about how you came by this information. Be assured that disclosing information to a Guardian journalist that could identify you does not mean they will reveal that information to anyone else. We are committed to protecting our sources.
- They may ask if you have or know of any documentary proof of what you told them.
- If you don't want to be identified as a source, they may want to discuss if any of the evidence you have could in theory be traced back to you.
- If appropriate they may suggest a more direct conversation such as a phone call or similar. To achieve this they may provide personal contact details.

DIVIDER

Sometimes you may get a reply from a reporter saying they're unable to help. This might be because:

- The reporter is unable to follow this up at this time due to absence or other commitments. They may suggest you contact a different journalist, or try again in future.
- The reporter doesn't cover the issues you have raised, or in the geographic region that they pertain to. They may suggest you contact someone else.
- The reporter believes the issue may not be a matter of public interest. For example if some person has committed some misconduct, we won't necessarily report on it unless we believe it has significant implications for the general public and that they have the right to know about.
